#### METHOD:

Start the parsnips, potatoes and turnips in a pot of cold water; bring to a boil to cook through.  Strain, let dry and place in bowl.  Add the cream and whole butter and season with salt and pepper.  Smash to chunky consistency.  Set aside; keep warm until ready to serve.

In a pan, heat the butter and add the pearl onions; cook until lightly browned.  Toss the lamb in flour to lightly coat the meat; add to the pan and cook to brown.  Once browned, take out and set aside.  Add the garlic; sweat until soft.  Add the wine and let simmer for 2 minutes.  Add the lamb stock, onions and lamb; let simmer until lamb is tender and thickened to coat the back of a spoon.   Add in the peas and corn to warm through.  

Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper.  Assemble on a plate to serve with the smashed root vegetables.  Garnish with chopped parsley.
