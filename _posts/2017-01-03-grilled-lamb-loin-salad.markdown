#### Yield:  12 servings

### INGREDIENTS	WEIGHTS/MEASURES  


Ingredient | Amount
:------|-------:
Pitted black olives	| 12 ounces
Red wine vinegar	| 9 tablespoons
Honey	| 3 tablespoons
Fresh oregano leaves finely chopped	| 3 tablespoons
Garlic, crushed	| 3 cloves
Olive oil	| 3/4 cup
American Lamb loins, trimmed of silver skin	| 6
Red onions, thinly sliced	| 6 small
Arugula	| 3 pounds
Giant Greek beans (gigondas) or great Northern beans,cooked and drained	| 1-1/2 pounds
Firm goat cheese, crumbled	| 1-1/2 cups

#### METHOD:
In Robot Coupe / food processor, combine olives, vinegar, honey, oregano and garlic.  Blend to puree.  With motor running, slowly add oil.  Remove 1 cup of the vinaigrette and generously brush it on the lamb loins.  Reserve the remaining vinaigrette for the salad.

Grill lamb loins for 15 to 20 minutes, turning once.  Use a meat thermometer to test for doneness:  145°F for medium-rare, 160°F for medium or 170°F for well.  Remove from heat, cover and let stand for 5 minutes.

In salad bowl, combine onions, arugula and beans.  Toss with vinaigrette and serve salad onto plates.  Thinly slice lamb loin and arrange on the top of the salads. Sprinkle with cheese.
