Hi Jim;

Sorry for so long getting this to you, too much work between the farm and the second job.

I would like the website to be fairly simple to look at and navigate.

I feel that there should be a way to easily view pricing and availability, links to other websites and orginizations and something about who we are and what we do.

I also feel that pictures, including a gallery of some sort is important. I generally get a better understanding of what people are and a sense of inclusion by being able to see different aspects of their farm or business via pictures.

Also, I prefer earth tones and backgrounds, maybe it helps connect people to the agriculture aspect. A recipe and cooking tips page is important also, along with pictures.

I chose 'Apple Creek Farm' more as a marketing name than anything else. Most websites such as Iowa Farmer's COOP and Eatwild list everybody alphabeticly. Also, i think 'Apple Creek Farm' is easy to remember and sounds familiar. It is more of a storefront name for marketing meats and later perhaps eggs and or fruits.

I do have a web domain, it is applecreekfarm.net .  I got it thru godaddy, you mayhave to talk me thru how to get access to it for you. The .com version is not available.

I talked to some people in Maine that are using the name and also direct market, and have the emails from them consenting to me using the name for the same purposes. We live in different geographical areas and it shouldnt be a problem.

Also, I have a face book page I started:  Apple Creek Farm / Iowa

I listed below some websites that look good to me for a variety of reasons, maybe some of it will help. These below look very professionally done.

http://joiafoodfarm.com/   http://superiorfarms.com/     http://www.oswaldgrassfedbeef.com/     


These below look more ameraturish to me, more like something I would produce using an inexpensive template, something that I want to avoid:

    http://www.lipesfamilyfarm.com/    http://www.carneyfamilyfarms.com/
http://www.prairiesedgeiowa.com/

I realize this will be a work in progress and wont be done overnight, probably the weak link will be me and my ability to get information to you in a timely manner.

I look forward to working with you, I can be reached at 641-895-9500 most days before noon. After that I am generally getting readyfor my evening shift at the factory. If you prefer we can also correspond using email.

Thanks,
Bart

Hi Jim, here are some ideas, please feel free to edit as you think it requires.

  Apple Creek Farm produces all natural lamb. No growth hormones, no antibiotics, no GMO feeds. All our lambing is done on pasture during spring green up, in sync with nature.

 Our sheep are never confined or kept in a feed lot. They are moved to fresh pasture every day or two, always using low stress stockmanship skills as taught by Temple Grandin and the late Bud Williams.

 We use intensive rotational grazing to promote healthy soil and pasture diversity, striving for a sustainable relationship between soil, plants and livestock. We don't use chemical sprays or artificial fertilizers, but rather use a holistic approach to maintaining pasture growth and variety of plant species.

Our Sheepdogs live with our flocks around the clock, always keeping a watchful eye to protect from prey animals. With that said, we have chosen to allow the local Coyote population to coexist as they haven't preyed on our sheep and are a valuable asset to keeping other prey animals out of their territory.

More info about me:

I grew up on a farm in Michigan, milking cows and haying with my brothers for our landlord, as well as raising and milking goats for our family.

After an enlistment in the Navy and a business venture in a welding company Bart met and married his wife, Trish. Together they raised five daughters. Trish obtained a degree in Elementary Education, and Bart desired a  return to his roots in agriculture. Hiring on as a foreman on a ranch in Colorado, he attended Ranching for Profit School, which changed everything he had known about ranching and livestock management. This gave cause to relocating to a more productive part of the country, Iowa.

After joining Practical Farmers of Iowa, I met John and Shirley Waite, and entered into a business lease with them, helping them to transform their farm from conventional farming to an all forage based livestock enterprise. Our goals are sustainable grazing practices, holistic management and all our products should be 100% all natural, with an emphasis on good land and animal stewardship.

Future plans include adding beef, poultry, pork and other on farm product sales, as well as helping to teach other farmers/ranchers and school aged children the possibilities of sustainable farming practices.  



Hope some of this helps.
Bart
